                <P>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a 2004 fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuar贸n from a
                    screenplay by Steve Kloves, based on the 1999 novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. It is the
                    sequel to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) and the third instalment in the Harry
                    Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma
                    Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The film follows
                    Harry's third year at Hogwarts and his quest to uncover the truth about his past, including the
                    connection recently-escaped Azkaban prisoner Sirius Black has to Harry and his deceased parents.

                    With this film, the Harry Potter series switched to a longer eighteen-month production cycle. Cuar贸n
                    was selected as director from a list that included Callie Khouri and Kenneth Branagh. The cast of
                    previous instalments returned for the film, with the additions of Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, and
                    Emma Thompson, among others. It was the first appearance of Michael Gambon as Professor Albus
                    Dumbledore, due to Richard Harris's death in 2002. Principal photography began in February 2003 at
                    Leavesden Film Studios. It was the first in the series to extensively use real-life locations, with
                    sets built in Scotland and scenes shot in London. Filming concluded in November 2003.

                    The film was released on 31 May 2004 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 June 2004 in North America. It
                    was the first Harry Potter film to use IMAX Technology and released into IMAX theatres. Prisoner of
                    Azkaban grossed a total of $797.5 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of
                    2004, behind Shrek 2. Critics praised Cuar贸n's direction and the lead actors' performances. It is
                    credited for marking a notable change in the franchise's tone and directing style, and is often
                    regarded by critics and fans alike as the best Harry Potter film. It was nominated for two Academy
                    Awards, Best Original Music Score and Best Visual Effects, at the 77th Academy Awards in 2004. It
                    was followed by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005.</P>
